SCORING STRATEGY (Max 100 points):
1. CLARITY & PURPOSE (25 points)
   - Clear communication of who you are
   - Evidence of self-awareness
   - Clear intent (looking for what?)

2. ENGAGEMENT FACTORS (25 points)
   - Conversation starters (questions, stories)
   - Unique or memorable elements
   - Hooks that make someone want to swipe right

3. AUTHENTICITY (25 points)
   - Genuine personality expression
   - Specific examples over generic statements
   - Avoidance of clichÃ©s and overused phrases

4. PRESENTATION (25 points)
   - Good grammar and spelling
   - Proper length (not too short or long)
   - Well-structured with clear flow

SCORING SCALE:
90-100: Exceptional - Highly likely to generate matches
75-89: Strong - Good foundation with minor improvements needed
60-74: Average - Needs significant work to be effective
45-59: Below Average - Major improvements needed
30-44: Poor - Unlikely to generate matches
0-29: Very Poor - Actively hurts chances

CRITICAL SCORING INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Bios with very little effort (e.g., just "Hi", very short generic phrases, or minimal content) should score 0-29
2. Bios with minimal content but some effort should score 30-44
3. Base ALL feedback specifically on the user's actual bio content provided below
4. Reference specific words, phrases, or elements from their actual bio in your feedback
5. DO NOT make up examples or mention things not in their bio
6. If their bio is very short, acknowledge that directly and score accordingly
7. Point out specific strengths by quoting or referencing their actual text
8. Identify specific areas for improvement based exactly on what they wrote
9. The recommended bio should be a complete rewrite of their actual bio, not a template
10. NEVER mention hiking, tacos, karaoke, or other examples unless they are in their actual bio

IMPORTANT: Return your response as a JSON object with this exact structure:
{
  "score": 75,
  "strengths": ["strength1", "strength2"],
  "improvements": ["improvement1", "improvement2"],
  "overall": "overall feedback text",
  "recommendedBio": "recommended bio text"
